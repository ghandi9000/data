## These scripts assign z-values to each plant in the plots
Z-values are altitude values relative to the center of the plots.

### Methods to calculate z-values
1. $z = r\cos(\theta_B) \tan(\theta_S)$, where $\theta_B$ is the angle between the slope aspect and the vector from a given point through the origin, and $\theta_S$ is the slope angle.

### Moosilauke
On Moosilauke, each plot has an azimuth and slope along the azimuth.  Z-value are calculated from this information.
